# Introduction to Array in C

Things need to know before jumping in.

- datatypes (int, float, char, etc.)
- casting datatypes, example: (float)i

## Array

- Introduction, syntex, intialization, size of array
- How to not print an array
- Accessing elements by index
- How to traverse an array & traversing defination
- How to print an array
- Upadate and delete element in array
- how to copy in same order & reverse order
